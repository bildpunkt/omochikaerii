Simple static Vite app tracking my personal progress through the **Higurashi: When They Cry** franchise by **07th Expansion**

A fun side-tracking project and a first look into Vue 3 and the Reactivity API. I generally plan not to take contributions, but if you have
a general improvement that makes sense, feel free to tell me about it and maybe I'll accept it!

## Development

You require a recent version of Node. Just go with stable!

* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Run live-reloading development with `npm run dev`
* Build for production using `npm run build`

## Structure

* Code is inside `src/`
* Static data is inside `src/data/`, the folders group the data into the different media types
